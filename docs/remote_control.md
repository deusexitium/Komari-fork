## Sunshine/Moonlight

An example setup using Sunshine/Moonlight tested under the following configuration:

1. Set the Moonlight resolution to `1366x768`.  
   - You can choose any FPS you prefer, but it's recommended to increase the video bitrate to around `20 Mbps` for clearer image quality.
2. When connecting to the Sunshine host, **do not resize** the Moonlight window — only drag it around if needed.
3. On the Sunshine host, launch MapleStory in **fullscreen mode** at `1366x768`.

## Geforce Now

For running the bot through Geforce Now, make sure both Geforce Now and MapleStory share the same resolution, with the game running in fullscreen mode (similar to the Windowed setup used in Sunshine/Moonlight).

Example setup:

1. Ensure Geforce Now resolution matches the in-game resolution.  
   - For instance, if MapleStory is set to `1366x768` fullscreen, configure Geforce Now to `1366x768` as well.
2. Use [**SRWE**](https://github.com/dtgDTGdtg/SRWE) to adjust the Geforce Now window size to exactly match the configured size (`1366x768`).
3. Use `BitBltArea` or direct handle selection for screen capture.
